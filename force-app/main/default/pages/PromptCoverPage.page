      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">We are glad you are here. The Prompt Engineering App enables you to interact with OpenAI API, create and store prompts,
        and receive AI-generated responses. Check the statistics above to see the current system usage. Happy prompting!

      <h2 style="font-size:3em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Project Description</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">
        `AI Gateway for Salesforce` is an open-source project for Salesforce customers that allows their admins and developers to
        interact with OpenAI API. Utilizing a custom Salesforce object named `Prompt__c`, this project enables developers
        and users to create and store prompts that are sent to the OpenAI chat completions API using the `gpt-4` and `gpt-3.5-turbo`
        models. The response from the API is then stored in the `PromptAnswer__c` object. This repository serves as a foundational
        tool for Salesforce customers interested in leveraging AI capabilities for B2B software and marketing applications.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">
        `AI Gateway for Salesforce` is a bare-bones implementation of OpenAI API. It is intended to be a template for other organizations
        to being experimenting with OpenAI API. The OpenAI user interface is written is a very simple Flow, so it should
        be easy for admins and developers to customize the user interface to meet their needs.
      </p>
      <h2 style="font-size:3em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Privacy Considerations</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">
        You need to make your own decision whether to used OpenAI API because it requires sending data to the Open AI servers. However,
        if you believe OpenAI's promises, then it should be safe. Here are some of the promises presented in the latest update
        to their privacy policy:
        <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy">https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy</a>.
      </p>
      <ol style="font-size:1.5em;">
        <li>OpenAI will not use customer data submitted via the API to train or improve their models unless the customer explicitly
          opts in to share their data for this purpose.</li>
        <li>Data sent through the API will be retained for a maximum of 30 days for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes, after
          which it will be deleted (unless required by law).</li>
        <li>Unlike ChatGPT-4, where saved conversations are used to improve the model, the API does not save conversations.</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">
        Here is some more information from OpenAI: "By default, OpenAI does not use customer data submitted via the API to train
        their models or improve their services. Data submitted for fine-tuning is only used to fine-tune the customer's model.
        OpenAI retains API data for 30 days for abuse and misuse monitoring purposes, and a limited number of authorized
        employees and third-party contractors can access this data solely for investigating and verifying suspected abuse.
        Data submitted through the Files endpoint, such as for fine-tuning a model, is retained until the user deletes the
        file."
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">
        Bottom line: according to these promises your data will not be saved and used for training. But, I would recommend that you
        read the OpenAI privacy policy and make your own decision about whether you want to use this project in your own
        org. As of Summer, 2023 we are still waiting for the OpenAI Business account to be available. I believe OpenAI will
        be able to provide more assurances about data privacy once the Business account is available.

      <h2 style="font-size:3em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Getting Started</h2>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">These are the post-intallation instructions for both unmanaged package and scratch org installation. </p>
      <h3 style="font-size:2em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Get OpenAPI Key and Org ID</h3>
      <ol style="font-size:1.5em;">
        <li>
          <a href="https://platform.openai.com/">Go to the OpenAI website</a> and sign up for an API account. You can get a free tier account, but you will be restricted
          in the number of API calls you can make. And you'll be restricted to the gpt-3.5-turbo model.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">Visit the API keys page</a> and generate a new key for this project. Keep it in a safe place, and don't put it
          in any repository.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings">Visit the Organization settings page</a> and copy the Organization ID. You'll need this later.</li>
      </ol>

      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Once you have your API key and Organization ID, you can install the `ai-gateway` package and start using it.</p>

      <h3 style="font-size:2em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Add OpenAI Keys to External Credential</h3>
      <ol style="font-size:1.5em;">
        <li>From the VS Code terminal, enter the command `make open` to go to the scratch org setup page.</li>
        <li>Enter "named" in the Quick Find box and select Named Credentials.</li>
        <li>Click on the External Credentials tab.</li>
        <li>Click on the OpenAI item to edit its details.</li>
        <li>In the `Principals` section, click on the down arrow in the `Actions` column next to `PromptEngineering` and select
          Edit.
        </li>
        <li>Click Add on Authentication Parameters.</li>
        <li>Under Parameter 1, enter "apiKey" for the Name.</li>
        <li>Enter the OpenAI API key you generated in the previous section for the Value.</li>
        <li>Click Add on Authentication Parameters to add your organization id as the second parameter.</li>
        <li>Under Parameter 2, enter "Org" for the Name and enter your Organization ID for the Value.</li>
        <li>Click Save for to update the external credentials Principals settings.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3 style="font-size:2em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Set Up Permissions for External Credential Principal</h3>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">The External Credential Principal is used to authenticate the external credential. You need to modify the `Prompt Engineering`
        permission set to gain permission to use it.</p>
      <ol style="font-size:1.5em;">
        <li>In the Quick Find box, enter "permission" and select Permission Sets.</li>
        <li>Click on the `Prompt Engineering` permission set.</li>
        <li>Click on `External Credential Principal Access` on the right side of the screen.</li>
        <li>Click Edit.</li>
        <li>Select the `OpenAI - PromptEngineering` item and click Add.</li>
        <li>Click Save.</li>
      </ol>
      <p style="font-size:1.5em;margin-bottom: 1em;">Congratulations! You have completed the setup required to use the OpenAI API from within you Salesforce org, and your
        API key is safely stored in Salesforce. You are ready to start using the sample prompts.</p>
